# Password-Generator

## Introduction

I was given a task to modify starter code to create an application that enables users to generate random passwords based on criteria that theyâ€™ve selected.

## Technology used

- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript

## Summary

When the user clicks "Generate Password" they are prompted with the following options:

- Password length (8-128 characters)
- If they would like their password to include lowercase letters
- If they would like their password to include uppercase letters
- If they would like their password to include numbers
- If they would like their password to include special characters

Once they have selected their options they are then presented with a randomly generated password based on the criteria.
